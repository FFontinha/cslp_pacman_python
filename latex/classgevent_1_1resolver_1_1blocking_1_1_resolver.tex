\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}A resolver that directly uses the system's resolver functions.

.. caution::

    This resolver is *not* cooperative.

This resolver has the lowest overhead of any resolver and
typically approaches the speed of the unmodified :mod:`socket`
functions. However, it is not cooperative, so if name resolution
blocks, the entire thread and all its greenlets will be blocked.

This can be useful during debugging, or it may be a good choice if
your operating system provides a good caching resolver (such as
macOS's Directory Services) that is usually very fast and
functionally non-blocking.

.. versionchanged:: 1.3a2
   This was previously undocumented and existed in :mod:`gevent.socket`.\end{DoxyVerb}
 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
